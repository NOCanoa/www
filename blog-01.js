  title: "Building a Browser That Respects You",
  content: [
    "There was a time when the internet felt different—when it wasn’t a maze of dark patterns designed to manipulate your attention, when software was built for the user, not for the highest bidder. Back then, a browser was simply a tool, a window to the world, not a marketplace disguised as an app.<br/><br/><strong>Somewhere along the way, that changed.</strong><br/><br/>Today, browsers are riddled with engagement traps. They track you, sell your data, shove crypto schemes in your face, and call it ‘innovation.’ But real innovation isn’t about bloated AI assistants or endless monetization tricks. Real innovation makes life simpler, not more exhausting.",
    "I built Zen because I believe the browser should serve you. It should be fast, transparent, and private by design—not as a checkbox feature, but as a philosophy. It should get out of your way, so you can get in, do what you need to do, and step away from the screen without feeling drained.<br/><br/>I’m not a corporation. I don’t have a marketing team crafting sleek slogans, nor a boardroom plotting engagement metrics. I’m just a developer who saw what was wrong and decided to fix it. Zen isn’t about gimmicks. It’s about respect—for your time, your privacy, and your right to a better web.<br/><br/>It won’t be perfect, and I won’t pretend to have all the answers. But with the help of a passionate community, I know we can build something that matters. A browser that doesn’t fight against you, but works with you.<br/><br/><br/><h1>There was a browser that kind of did this—Arc.</h1><br/>For a while, it felt like a breath of fresh air: a browser that challenged conventions, that cared about design, that aimed to make browsing feel intentional rather than chaotic. It rethought the interface, introduced thoughtful features, and for a moment, it seemed like someone finally got it.<br/><br/><strong>But then, things changed.</strong><br/><br/>Arc was discontinued for Mac, leaving its early adopters stranded. The Windows version, when it finally arrived, was a shadow of what was promised—slow, unstable, missing core features. What started as a vision for a better browser quickly became yet another company chasing after monetization, pivoting to AI gimmicks anI’m not a corporation.

    "I won’t pretend Arc didn’t inspire me. It did. There’s a lot to admire in its design philosophy, in its willingness to rethink how we interact with the web. But inspiration isn’t imitation. I’m taking the good—thoughtful UX, a clean interface, a focus on user control—and cutting out the bad. No forced online accounts. No feature bloat disguised as innovation. No chasing trends just to stay relevant.<br/><br/>Zen isn’t about maximizing engagement. It’s about minimizing friction. It’s about building a browser that works with you, not on you. And beyond that, I’m exploring my own ideas—rethinking not just how a browser looks, but how it feels to use. How it fits into your life without demanding more of your attention than necessary.",
