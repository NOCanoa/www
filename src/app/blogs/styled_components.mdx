# Introduction to styled components

When I discovered about styled-components (ðŸ’…) I remember that I **loved** it âœ¨ (I can't stop using it now). In this article, I'm going to teach you the wonders this magnificent framework can offer to you and how you can use it from a basic level and some fun facts at the end ;)

    This article is written for people who have atleast a basic knowledge about React and programming. Although this is a beginner lesson, there are still things to know before diving into this big topic.

## That's great, but what's `styled-components`?

Styled-components allows you to create and style (via template litterals) re-useable react components. This is a nice way to go since it allows you
to create normal React components with styles attached to it.

In other words, Styled-components keeps track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their styles and nothing else, fully automatically. It also has the followuing features:

- Automatic vendor prefixing
- Unique class names
- Elimination of dead styles


## Where do I start?

First of all, you will need to create a file (we are going to use TypeScript for this article) in orther to declare a styled component. Note that this can be done anywhere but I like to make things clean.

```typescript
// styles.ts

export const MyElement = styled.div`
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;

    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center; // did I just center a div?
`
```

It's that simple! now, you can import this component and use it as a normal element.

```tsx
// index.tsx

import styled from "styled-components";
import { MyElement } from "./styles";

function App() {
    return (
        <MyElement>Hello, World!</MyElement>
    )
}
```

### Passing props to components

One thing great about styled components is thaty they are __functional__. This means that we can style elements dynamically. The following example will show how to adapt an element based on their props:

```tsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.div`
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;

    background: ${(props: any) => props.primary ? `red` : `blue`};
`

const Text = styled.div`
    color: ${(props: any) => props.color || "#000"}
`

function App() {
    return (
        <Button primary>
            <Text color={"blue"}>Hello, World!</Text>
        </Button>
    )
}
```

## You survived till the end!

If there is any part that you didn't understand from this article, it's ok! Styled-components require lot's of time to master.
