# The C preprocessor

The C preprocessor is a macro processor automatically used by the C programming language to transform your program before it actually compiles it. The C preprocessor (despite it's name) also works for other "c extensions" (`C++`, `Objective-C`, ...).

In this article, we are going to explore in detail the C preprocessor and explore all the creative things you can do with it.

## History

The preprocessor was introduced to C around 1973 at the urging of Alan Snyder and also in recognition of the usefulness of the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I. Its original version offered only file inclusion and simple string replacement using #include and #define for parameterless macros, respectively. It was extended shortly after, firstly by Mike Lesk and then by John Reiser, to incorporate macros with arguments and conditional compilation.

The C preprocessor was part of a long macro-language tradition at Bell Labs, which was started by Douglas Eastwood and Douglas McIlroy in 1959.

## Macros

There are several uses for the preprocessor that are very usefull (or even necessary) for some cases such as: including files and making choices depending on constants.

<Alert type="info">
    **How to use macros?**

    All preprocessing directives begin with a `#` symbol at the start of the line (without counting white spaces).
</Alert>


### Including files

The include directive allows the programmer to insert another file into the source code. This is tipically used to include a header file containing functions declared outside the source file.

**note**: The name of the header file that you wish to include. A header file is a C file that typically ends in ".h" and contains declarations and macro definitions which can be shared between several source files.

There are 2 possible syntaxes in order to include another file:

```c
#include <file> new-line
```

and

```c
#include "file" new-line
```

<Alert type="info">
    **What's the difference?**

    What differs is the locations in which the preprocessor searches for the file to be included.

    - `#include <filename>`   The preprocessor searches in an implementation-defined manner, normally in directories pre-designated by the compiler/IDE. This method is normally used to include header files for the C standard library and other header files associated with the target platform.

    - `#include "filename"`   The preprocessor also searches in an implementation-defined manner, but one that is normally used to include programmer-defined header files and typically includes same directory as the file containing the directive (unless an absolute path is given).
</Alert>

### Making conditions

Making conditions with the C preprocessor will allow you to determine what code should be included into the resultant source code. There are 6 different directives each one with it's own purpose:

#### Make decision based on condition

The `if` directive will take a condition and if it is true, it will include the code inside it. Note that the `if` directive must end with [`#endif`](#endif) as showed in the following code:

```c
#if condition new-line
    block
#endif
```

The following programm checks if a variable is set to 0

```c
#if DEBUG != 0
    printf("Im here!");
#endif
```

#### Check if a macro exists

The `ifdef` directory works similar to the [`#if`](#make-decision-based-on-condition) directive there's a small differentiation. It's whole purpose is to check if a macro has been defined (as the name suggests).

```c
#ifdef my-macro new-line
    block
#endif
```

<Alert type="info">
    **Woah, what about `#if defined(macro)`?**

    The difference between the two is that `#ifdef` can only use a single condition,
    while `#if defined(NAME)` can do compound conditionals.

    For example in your case:
    ```c
    #if defined(WIN32) && !defined(UNIX)
        /* Do windows stuff */
    #elif defined(UNIX) && !defined(WIN32)
        /* Do linux stuff */
    #else
        /* Error, both can't be defined or undefined same time */
    #endif
    ```
</Alert>

#### Check if macro does not exists

The `ifndef` directly is exactly the opposite to [`#ifdef`](#check-if-a-macro-exists) (with same exact syntax). This would be the equivalent of `#if !defined(MACRO)`.

#### Action when condition is false

The `#else` directive provides an alternate action when used with the [`#if`](#make-decision-based-on-condition), [`#ifdef`](#check-if-a-macro-exists), or [`#ifndef`](#check-if-macro-does-not-exists) directives. The preprocessor will include the C source code that follows the #else statement when the condition for the [`#if`](#make-decision-based-on-condition), [`#ifdef`](#check-if-a-macro-exists), or [`#ifndef`](#check-if-macro-does-not-exists) directive evaluates to false. The following code is an example of `#else`:

```c
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("it's debug time!\n");
#else
    printf("no debug :( \n");
#endif
```

#### endif

In the C Programming Language, the #endif directive closes off the following directives: [`#if`](#make-decision-based-on-condition), [`#ifdef`](#check-if-a-macro-exists), or [`#ifndef`](#check-if-macro-does-not-exists). When the #endif directive is encountered, preprocessing of the opening directive (#if, #ifdef, or #ifndef) is completed.

### Define and expand macros

A macro is a piece of code in a program that is replaced by the value of the macro. Whenever a macro name is encountered by the compiler, it replaces the name with the definition of the macro. Macro definitions need not be terminated by a semi-colon(`;`).

#### Define a macro

In order to define a macro or a symbolic constant, we need to use the `#define` directive. This can then be used all over the program at compile time.

```c
#define PI 3.14
#define MULTIPLY(x, y) (x * y)
```

> Notice the parentheses around the arguments, a good practice to avoid issues when the macro is replaced in the precompilation process.

- The first define is called a `symbolic constant` and it's as simple as it gets.
- The real fun comes with macros. Macros can accept arguments and even [`variadic arguments`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html). Macros can be called like normal functions:
    - `printf("%i\n", MULTIPLY(1, 5));`

<Alert type="info">
    **Fun facts about macros**

    Symbolic constants don't need to necessarily have a value. This could be useful for things like include guards.

    You can add multilines to macros by appending `\` and the end of the line:
    ```c
    #define MY_MACRO(x) if (x) \
        printf("hello\n");
    ```
</Alert>

#### Undefine a macro

The `#undef` directive tells the preprocessor to remove all definitions for the specified macro. A macro can be redefined after it has been removed by the #undef directive.

Once a macro is undefined, the [`#ifdef`](#check-if-a-macro-exists) directive on that macro will evaluate to false.

```c
#undef macro-name
```

### User defined errors/warnings

The directive `#error` causes the preprocessor to report a fatal error. The tokens forming the rest of the line following `#error` are used as the error message.

```c
#ifndef FOO
#error "FOO need to be defined!"
#endif
```

The directive `#warning` is like `#error`, but causes the preprocessor to issue a warning and continue preprocessing. The tokens following `#warning` are used as the warning message.
You might use `#warning` in obsolete header files, with a message directing the user to the header file which should be used instead.

<Alert type="info">
    **Note on errors and warnings**

    Neither `#error` nor `#warning` macro-expands its argument. Internal whitespace sequences are each replaced with a single space. The line must consist of complete tokens. It is wisest to make the argument of these directives be a single string constant; this avoids problems with apostrophes and the like.

</Alert>

### Useful Preprocessor Macros for Debugging

ANSI C defines some useful preprocessor macros and variables, also called "magic constants", include:

* `__FILE__`: The name of the current file, as a string literal
* `__LINE__`: Current line of the source file, as a numeric literal
* `__DATE__`: Current system date, as a string
* `__TIME__`: Current system time, as a string
* `__TIMESTAMP__`: Date and time (non-standard)
* `__cplusplus`: undefined when your C code is being compiled by a C compiler.
* `__func__`: Current function name of the source file, as a string (part of C99)
* `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__`: "decorated" Current function name of the source file, as a string (in GCC; non-standard)

<Alert type="info">
    **More macros!**

    There are lost and lots of more macros. Here you have the [full list](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/j/guide-to-predefined-macros-in-c-compilers-gcc-clang-msvc-etc..html) and [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html)

</Alert>

### The pragma directive

The `pragma` ([pragmatic information](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Pragmas.html)) directive is part of the standard, but the meaning of any pragma depends on the software implementation of the standard that is used. The #pragma directive provides a way to request special behavior from the compiler. This directive is most useful for programs that are unusually large or that need to take advantage of the capabilities of a particular compiler.

**note**: pragma is usually followed by a single token, which represents a command for the compiler to obey. You should check the software implementation of the C standard you intend on using for a list of the supported tokens. Not surprisingly, the set of commands that can appear in #pragma directives is different for each compiler; you'll have to consult the documentation for your compiler to see which commands it allows and what those commands do.

here is an example of a common usage to only include the header file once in order to stop re-defines:

```c
#pragma once
```

#### Stringizing and concatenation

Sometimes you may want to convert a macro argument into a string constant. Parameters are not replaced inside string constants, but you can use the ‘#’ preprocessing operator instead. When a macro parameter is used with a leading ‘#’, the preprocessor replaces it with the literal text of the actual argument, converted to a string constant. Unlike normal parameter replacement, the argument is not macro-expanded first. This is called `stringizing`.

```c
#define PRINT_NAME(x) printf("%s\n", #x);
```

you can concatenate by using the operator `##`.

```c
#define CONCATENATE(prefix, sufix) prefix ## sufix
CONCATENATE("Hello, ", "world") // -> "Hello, world"
```


### How to do evil with macros

This is a little thing I did quite a time before, it is used to destroy the C language by using macros. basically, it replaces important keywords such as `if` and replaces them with the wrong things.

### Conclusion

First of all, I would like to congratulate you for reading this article and surviving till the end. The C preprocessor is a great tool have the ability for the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control. Some people might be confused at the beginning, trying to understand what the preprocessor actually is. I hope that by reading this, you have a more clear understanding about the wonders the C preprocessor can offer and how to use it most effectively.
