# Introduction to styled components

When I discovered about styled-components (ðŸ’…) I remember that I **loved** it âœ¨ (I can't stop using it now). In this post, I'm going to teach you the wonders this magnificent framework can offer to you and how you can use it from a basic level and some fun facts at the end ;)

**Intended audience**: This article is written for experienced React developers. I assume knowledge about React, styled-components, and functional programming principles.

## That's great, but what's \`styled-components\`?

Styled-components allows you to create and style (via template litterals) re-useable react components. This is a nice way to go since it allows you
to create normal React components with styles attached to it.

Styled-components keeps track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their styles and nothing else, fully automatically.
