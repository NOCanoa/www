# All about f-strings üêç

F-strings provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax. It should be noted that an f-string is really an expression evaluated at run time, not a constant value. In this article, I am going to explain you the basics about Python's f-strings and some more "expert" formating hacks you can benefit from.

## How to create a basic f-string

F-strings in Python are declared as a string constant with a f prefixed to it. Expressions can be declared inside f-strings by surrounding them inside `{}`. Note that the formating part of the string will be exactly the same as for using `str.format()`.

```py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

n = 1
s = f"{n} + {n * 2} = {add(n, n * 2)}" # 1 + 2 = ?
```

    **Not everything is *perfect***

    In python's f-string backslash Cannot be used in format string directly.

    ```py
    f"Look at my new line: {ord('\n')}"
    # Syntax Error: f-string expression part cannot include a backslash
    ```

    **Faster than format**

    > ‚ÄúF-strings provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax. It should be noted that an f-string is really an expression evaluated at run time, not a constant value. In Python source code, an f-string is a literal string, prefixed with f, which contains expressions inside braces. The expressions are replaced with their values.‚Äù
    ~ [Source](https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/#abstract)

    At runtime, the expression inside the curly braces is evaluated in its own scope and then put together with the string literal part of the f-string. By doing it this way, it allows f-string to be faster than `str.format()`

    **How to ignore curly braces**

    In order to ignore `{}`, we will need to surround those curly braces with __MORE__ curly braces.

    ```py
    f"Hey, {{name}}"
    # >> Hey, {name}
    ```
</Alert>

# Formating values in f-strings

You can specify format inside f-strings that allows you to define you each of these values are represented. Note how in the last example, we make the use of `=`. This is because you can also add characters instead of white spaces.

## Aligment

```py
print(f"|{variable:25}|")
print(f"|{variable:<25}|")
print(f"|{variable:>25}|")
print(f"|{variable:=^25}|")
```

This code will output the following text in the terminal:

```
|HELLO                    |
|HELLO                    |
|                    HELLO|
|==========HELLO==========|
```

- `^`: Forces the expression within the curly braces to be left-aligned. This is the default for strings.
- `>`: Forces the expression within the curly braces to be right-aligned. This is the default for numbers.
- `<`: Forces the expression within the curly braces to be centered.

## Debugging format

This formating argument can help the user to debug more effectively. By using the `=` symbol, you will be able to output the variable as follows:

```py
variable = "hello"
print(f"My debug: {variable = }") # >> My debug: variable = "hello"
```

## Formating data types

There are many ways to represent strings and numbers when using f-strings. The most common
ones that you will need for this course are shown below:

- `%`: Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays in fixed ('f') format, followed by a percent sign.
- `d`: Decimal Integer. This uses a comma as the number separator character.
- `n`: Number. This is the same as d except that it uses the current locale setting toinsert the appropriate number separator characters.
- `s`: String format‚Äîthis is the default type for strings
- `e`: Exponent notation. Prints the number in scientific notation using the letter ‚Äòe‚Äô to indicate the exponent. The default precision is 6. f Fixed-point notation. Displays the number as a fixed-point number. The default precision is 6.

```py
import math
variable = math.pi

print(f"Using Numeric {variable = }")
print(f"With two decimal places: {variable:.2f}")
print(f"With four decimal places: {variable:.3f}")
print(f"With two decimal places and a comma: {variable:,.2f}")
print(f"With a forced plus sign: {variable:+.2f}\n")
```

```
>> Using Numeric variable = 3.141592653589793
>> With two decimal places: 3.14
>> With four decimal places: 3.142
>> With two decimal places and a comma: 3.14
>> With a forced plus sign: +3.14
```

## Use of Tabs and Spacing

Program output is often required to be in tabular form. f-strings are very useful in formatting
this kind of output. The following lines produce a tidily aligned set of columns with integers and
their squares and cubes, using spaces to align the columns. Notice the use of the field width to
ensure that all the numbers are right-aligned:

```py
print(f'Number Square Cube')
for x in range(1, 11):
    print(f'{x:2d} {x*x:3d} {x*x*x:4d}')
```
