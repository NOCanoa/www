```css
input:placeholder-shown { border-color: green; }
```

This pseudo-class represents any `<input>` or `<textarea>` element that is currently displaying placeholder text ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:placeholder-shown)).

<Alert type="warn">
    **Input must have a placeholder**

    If your input/textarea element does not have a placeholder, the PS selector will not work. Here are some examples of empty placeholders.

    ```html
    <!-- both of these do not work! -->
    <input />
    <input placeholder="" />
    ```
</Alert>

Placeholder-shown (PS) can be used for different purposes such as dynamically changing styles to an input depending on whether it's empty or not.

<Playground html={`<input placeholder="Type something!" />`} css={`input {
    border: 3px solid blue;
    padding: 3px;

    outline: none !important;
}

input:placeholder-shown {
    border-color: red;
}`} />
