```js
document.designMode = 'on';
```

__**document.designMode**__ controls whether the entire document is editable. Valid values are `"on"` and `"off"`. According to the specification, this property is meant to default to `"off"`. Firefox follows this standard. The earlier versions of Chrome and IE default to "inherit". Starting in Chrome 43, the default is `"off"` and `"inherit"` is no longer supported. In IE6-10, the value is capitalized.
